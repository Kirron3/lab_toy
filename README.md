# 🎓 Git Practice Project

## 📋 Overview
Welcome to my Git practice project!  
This repository is a space for me to learn and experiment with Git commands and workflows. Currently, it’s **empty**—no code or configurations—just this README file.

The goal is to get comfortable with Git while working on this project for my training.

## 🛠️ Usage
This is my personal sandbox to practice the following:
- Cloning repositories
- Creating and switching branches
- Committing changes
- Pushing and pulling from remote repositories

I will be experimenting with different Git commands and concepts, and this will help me solidify my understanding of version control.

## 📚 Learning Objectives
- Familiarize myself with Git commands and workflows.
- Gain hands-on experience with branching and merging.
- Learn how to track changes effectively.

## 🚀 Next Steps
As I progress, I may add content to this repository. For now, it serves as a foundation for my Git learning journey. 

Looking forward to mastering Git! 😊
